# Fertility Visuals Specification

## Purpose

Defines a shared, theme-aware visual language for fertility observations, derived status, and forecasts across the Calendar, Status, Cycle chart, and History/Stats surfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Fertility states use a shared theme-aware visual language

The app SHALL assign a consistent visual treatment to each existing derived day status (`pre-fertile`, `fertile`, `post-peak`, and `post-calendar`) in both light and dark themes. Each treatment SHALL preserve the existing status meaning and remain distinguishable from the base surface. Surfaces that display the precise status SHALL keep all four statuses distinguishable from each other. The Calendar's default presentation MAY render the collapsed `Before`/`Fertile`/`After` phase aliases instead, in which case the phase treatments SHALL reuse the existing theme-aware status treatments and the precise status SHALL remain available in the Status view, the full-detail presentation, and accessible text.

#### Scenario: Status states remain distinct in dark mode

- **WHEN** the user views recorded days representing all four derived day statuses in dark mode
- **THEN** each status has a readable, visually distinguishable treatment
- **AND** the day number remains readable against its treatment

#### Scenario: Light-mode status meaning is preserved

- **WHEN** the user views the same recorded statuses in light mode
- **THEN** the status meanings remain the same as before the visual treatment change
- **AND** no status is reassigned to a different meaning

#### Scenario: Calendar phase aliases do not change status meaning

- **WHEN** the default Calendar presentation renders a recorded day
- **THEN** it MAY show the collapsed `Before`, `Fertile`, or `After` phase for the underlying status
- **AND** the precise status is still available in the Status view, the full-detail presentation, and accessible text

### Requirement: Important fertility distinctions meet contrast and non-color requirements

Normal text in the affected fertility surfaces SHALL meet a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its adjacent background. Meaningful graphical state boundaries, markers, and indicator shapes SHALL meet a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors. Important distinctions SHALL have a non-color cue or an equivalent textual/legend cue when color alone would not be sufficient. In the simplified Calendar, the color-coded monitor marker SHALL be paired with accessible text or detail information identifying Low, High, or Peak, while the menses stripe provides a non-color cue for its meaning. The same requirement SHALL apply to the distinction between a derived day and a projected day.

#### Scenario: Dark-mode text is readable

- **WHEN** a user views Calendar, Status, Cycle chart, or History/Stats in dark mode
- **THEN** day numbers, status text, forecast labels, and chart labels are readable against their actual adjacent backgrounds

#### Scenario: Status remains understandable without color

- **WHEN** a user cannot distinguish two status colors or has color-vision limitations
- **THEN** borders, line styles, marker shapes, labels, the grouped legend, or accessible text still communicate the important distinction

#### Scenario: Monitor reading has a text equivalent

- **WHEN** a Calendar cell displays a color-coded monitor marker
- **THEN** the exact Low, High, or Peak value is available through accessible text, the summary, or the day-detail surface

#### Scenario: Projected days are distinguishable without color

- **WHEN** a Calendar cell displays a projected day that is otherwise indistinguishable by color from a derived day
- **THEN** a non-color cue such as a border, pattern, marker, label, or accessible text communicates that the day is projected
- **AND** the cue is available on every surface that shows projected days

### Requirement: Legends describe the active visual vocabulary

Each surface that exposes fertility states SHALL provide a legend or equivalent labels whose colors, line styles, borders, and marker shapes match the items shown in that surface. The Calendar's default legend MAY use a grouped, phase-first vocabulary for the simplified statuses, menses stripe, and monitor readings, and SHALL describe the projected-day treatment whenever projection is enabled, while a full-detail legend SHALL explain any additional indicators exposed by that presentation. No surface SHALL list an ovulation estimate, because the shared vocabulary defines none. Status, Cycle chart, and History/Stats surfaces SHALL continue to describe their own active treatments.

#### Scenario: Calendar default legend covers the simple vocabulary

- **WHEN** the Calendar is shown in its default simple presentation
- **THEN** the legend explains `Before`, `Fertile`, `After`, the menses stripe, and monitor readings
- **AND** its samples match the corresponding day-cell treatments

#### Scenario: Calendar legend covers displayed states

- **WHEN** the Calendar legend is displayed
- **THEN** it explains the active Calendar status categories, forecast cues, projected-day cues, and raw markers that can appear in the current presentation
- **AND** it contains no status-source or record-provenance entry

#### Scenario: Calendar full-detail legend covers additional layers

- **WHEN** the Calendar exposes full-detail indicators
- **THEN** the legend explains every additional forecast or intercourse cue visible in the day cells
- **AND** it lists no ovulation estimate

#### Scenario: Other surfaces retain their active legends

- **WHEN** a user views Status, the Cycle chart, or History/Stats
- **THEN** each surface's legend continues to describe the treatments that surface actually displays

### Requirement: Theme changes do not change interpretation

Changing between light and dark themes SHALL NOT change any derived status, source, forecast, provenance marker, or algorithm-enabled state.

#### Scenario: Theme toggle preserves data meaning

- **WHEN** the user switches themes while viewing the same records
- **THEN** the displayed status, source, forecast, and provenance meanings remain identical
- **AND** only their visual presentation changes

### Requirement: Visual layers remain distinguishable without source or provenance

The app SHALL visually distinguish raw observations (including monitor readings, menses, and intercourse), derived day status, future forecast, and projected cycle days in the presentation where each layer is shown. A projected cycle day SHALL use the same predictive visual cue as a forecast day, so that a projected day is distinguishable from a derived day by the same means. The simple Calendar presentation MAY prioritize the phase, menses stripe, and monitor marker while deferring secondary layers to full detail or day details. Deferring a visual layer SHALL NOT hide or remove the underlying record or change its interpretation. The app SHALL NOT expose a confirmed/predicted status source treatment or an inferred-record provenance treatment, each derived status SHALL have exactly one treatment, and the app SHALL NOT define a single-day ovulation estimate treatment.

#### Scenario: Status has a single treatment

- **WHEN** two days have the same derived status
- **THEN** they use the same status treatment
- **AND** no status treatment is varied by an evidence source

#### Scenario: Forecast is not confused with derived data

- **WHEN** a future fertile-window forecast is displayed
- **THEN** it uses a predictive visual cue distinct from the derived status treatments
- **AND** the cue remains identifiable without relying on color alone

#### Scenario: Projected days reuse the forecast cue

- **WHEN** a projected cycle day is displayed
- **THEN** it uses the same predictive visual cue as a forecast day
- **AND** it is distinguishable from a derived day without relying on color alone

#### Scenario: Raw readings remain distinct from derived status

- **WHEN** a stored monitor reading is displayed on a day that also carries a derived status
- **THEN** the reading's marker remains visible over the status treatment
- **AND** the underlying reading value remains legible

#### Scenario: Simple presentation does not remove underlying data

- **WHEN** the simple Calendar presentation defers a secondary visual layer
- **THEN** the corresponding record and value remain available through the day-entry or full-detail surface
- **AND** no stored value or interpretation changes as a result of the display choice

#### Scenario: No source or provenance treatment is defined

- **WHEN** the shared visual vocabulary is inspected
- **THEN** it defines no confirmed/predicted source treatment
- **AND** it defines no inferred-record provenance treatment

#### Scenario: No ovulation estimate treatment is defined

- **WHEN** the shared visual vocabulary is inspected
- **THEN** it defines no single-day ovulation estimate treatment
- **AND** no surface renders one
